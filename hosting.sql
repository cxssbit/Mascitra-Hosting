Any longer than that, you&rsquo;re likely to lose them. Online shoppers want to find their merchandise fast. 79% of buyers will not return to your site if it&rsquo;s too slow and 52% of shoppers said that fast loading pages keep them loyal to a site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong>-beginner bloggers want the site to do most of the work for them. Beginners should look for easy and uncompleted installs, drag and drop website builders, free domain names, and stat trackers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; there are two big reasons to consider a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hostadvice.com/guide/web-hosting-101/top-5-security-features-need-web-hosting/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://hostadvice.com/guide/web-hosting-101/top-5-security-features-need-web-hosting/\'); return false;\">secure website</a>&mdash;server shutdown and virus prevention. You&rsquo;ll usually pay a bit more for them, but you won&rsquo;t want the server crashing during the holiday shopping season. You&rsquo;ll also want to avoid nasty viruses that steal your personal information and shut down your computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doteasy.com/web-hosting-articles/the-boundaries-of-web-hosting-support.cfm\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.doteasy.com/web-hosting-articles/the-boundaries-of-web-hosting-support.cfm\'); return false;\"><strong>Support</strong></a>-how quickly do you expect an answer to a technical problem? If you want the availability of a 24/7 tech or customer service representative, you&rsquo;ll want to look for a web host provider that will respond quickly. Filing a trouble ticket and waiting for an answer will cost you downtime, especially if your question isn&rsquo;t answered fully on the first try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strong Track Record</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the best web hosting services for blogs dovetail nicely with WordPress programs and plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type of Server</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hostingfacts.com/different-types-of-web-hosting/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://hostingfacts.com/different-types-of-web-hosting/\'); return false;\">four types of servers</a>. Shared servers are cheaper, but they go down more because the server is shared with many other subscribers. VPS costs a bit more, and while it shares space on the server, your space is cut off from other subscribers, so if there&rsquo;s a problem, it wasn&rsquo;t caused by another subscriber. Dedicated space is expensive enough that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for most people, but it&rsquo;s less likely to crash. The fourth type of server is a cloud system. It works much like the VPS system. It uses multiple servers in a network and is more secure than traditional VPS and shared servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a video that quickly explains the difference between the types of servers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How Do the Best Blog Hosting Sites Measure Up?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you are aware that you can expect to pay a bit more for having more space on the server, user-friendly features, faster speed, and around-the-clock support, you can prioritize which of these&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/web-hosting-beginner-guide/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/web-hosting-beginner-guide/\'); return false;\">factors</a>&nbsp;you want to dedicate the bulk of your monthly costs towards. Set your standards and look for the best web host for your blog. Here&rsquo;s what to know about some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/blog-platform-comparison-chart/\">top hosting platforms</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for WordPress &ndash; the largest blogging community on the web. The basic version, WordPress.com, is hosted on the WordPress server. It&rsquo;s easy enough for a beginner to set up a blog and it&rsquo;s free. It&rsquo;s perfect if you don&rsquo;t care about doing a lot of customization. WordPress.com offers upgrades for a fee. When you are ready for an upgrade, you&rsquo;ll need to switch to WordPress.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/free-wordpress-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\">RELATED POST: Best Free WordPress Hosting Providers Reviews &amp; Ratings</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress.org is the big brother of WordPress.com. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to install, and you won&rsquo;t need to know coding to put up an eye-catching website, but you&rsquo;ll need to get your own host and domain. This platform is highly customizable, and it offers lots of free and paid options&hellip;see below for the best way to get started with WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgatorbh1\" target=\"_blank\">Hostgator</a>&nbsp;<em>(this is what I recommend)</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hostgator is one of the best web blog hosts that keeps costs low. They&nbsp;cater to every beginner blogger and it&rsquo;s easy to get started. Website builders can get a WordPress site immediately with a one-click installation.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgatorbh2\" target=\"_blank\">Hostgator</a>&nbsp;has a high-quality server that is as fast as it is secure. If tech and coding aren&rsquo;t your forte, you&rsquo;ll love the 24/7 support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/hostgator-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">CHECK OUT OUR HOSTGATOR REVIEW HERE!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blogger</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the earliest bloggers fell in love with the Blogger platform. Content is easy to post and publish. Blogger has a few nice little&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.hostbaby.com/2012/08/website-widgets-what-are-they-and-why-do-i-need-them/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://blog.hostbaby.com/2012/08/website-widgets-what-are-they-and-why-do-i-need-them/\'); return false;\">widgets</a>, but you&rsquo;ll need to get familiar with some code to customize your site to bring it out of the elementary age. It&rsquo;s owned by Google, which means it&rsquo;s easy to integrate all of the Google apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tumblr</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumblr is another site that is free and unusually easy to set up, even for a beginner. The features on Tumblr rival those of WordPress.com and Blogger. Tumblr is owned by Yahoo, so bloggers that love the Yahoo culture and community will favor it as a web host. Reblog is a feature that is unique to Tumblr. Reblog makes it easy to repost content from other sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Squarespace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Squarespace is growing in popularity because bloggers don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice elegance for coding skills. It&rsquo;s one of the few sites that gives bloggers the ability to create an attractive, high-quality website without knowing an ounce of code. All of the news regarding Squarespace isn&rsquo;t fabulous. Theme and plugin support is fair, but not awesome. If you&rsquo;re not sure about it, take the free trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"best-blog-hosting-sites-2\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/best-blog-hosting-sites-2.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weebly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers that are looking for a website that maximizes the potential for SEO will love Weebly, where the SEO capabilities are wired right into the site. Weebly has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.simbla.com/Drag_and_drop_website_builder4\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.simbla.com/Drag_and_drop_website_builder4\'); return false;\">drag and drop features</a>which make site building easy in some respects, but editing can be a little less user-friendly. The good news is that it&rsquo;s free to start and you can pay for upgrades as desired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a fun and attractive website, you&rsquo;ll certainly find it at Wix. The drag and drop website builder practically builds itself into something that looks amazing. The main downside to Wix is that they charge for everything. A great looking website could cost you plenty. The text editor, fonts, and templates are free, but a lot of the features that make a site great can put you in the poorhouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joomla</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joomla is the old soul of blogging platforms. It isn&rsquo;t great at being user-friendly, but if you have a little coding knowledge, you might just love it. Joomla offers over 6000 free&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/url-domain-extensions-stand-needed-case-wondering/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/url-domain-extensions-stand-needed-case-wondering/\'); return false;\">extensions</a>. Beginners beware&mdash;this web platform is not for you. The first month is free, but it can get expensive after that. Attach it to a money-making site to get your money&rsquo;s worth from Joomla. This platform works best for Joomla developers and website managers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Medium</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that there is little room for customization with Medium because it&rsquo;s owned by Twitter. Consider Medium the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.briansolis.com/2015/02/medium-vs-twitter-tech-war-san-francisco-contextmatters-episode-4/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.briansolis.com/2015/02/medium-vs-twitter-tech-war-san-francisco-contextmatters-episode-4/\'); return false;\">tweet version</a>&nbsp;of the blogging world. It&rsquo;s short on looks, but long on experience for writers that want a streamlined platform where their words take center stage. When you want to give nothing but the facts, Medium is your platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts on the Best Web Hosts</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The adage of getting what you pay for doesn&rsquo;t necessarily hold true when choosing the best web hosting for blogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extra widgets and templates can add up costs without adding value to your blog&hellip;while paying a few extra dollars for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgatorbh3\" target=\"_blank\">reliable, secure server with Hostgator</a>&nbsp;offers excellent value at&nbsp;<strong><em>just $2.92/month</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s a BONUS DEAL Exclusive for YOU:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, I&#39;ve negotiated a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgatorbp2\" target=\"_blank\">SPECIAL 72% OFF DISCOUNT with HOSTGATOR</a></strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVE for you, my blog readers, so your hosting costs can be as low as&nbsp;<strong>$2.92 per month!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgator\" target=\"_blank\">GET HOSTING FOR ONLY $2.92/MONTH HERE</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You won&#39;t get a better deal anywhere like this!&nbsp;Hurry!

You are able to create a blog with many different blogging platforms, such as WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger and more...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"WordPress, Tumblr and blogger market share\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pie-chart-blogging-platforms.png\" style=\"height:400px; width:695px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, given that there are over 72 million active users using WordPress today (<a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/mesmerizing-wordpress-stats/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/mesmerizing-wordpress-stats/\'); return false;\">1</a>), it&rsquo;s clear which platform is the boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of my own blogs and sites&nbsp;are built with&nbsp;the WordPress blogging platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s why:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>It&rsquo;s FREE for everyone to use</strong>&nbsp;(including themes, layouts, and add-ons that many other blogging platforms don&#39;t provide).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>It&rsquo;s super easy for you to set up on your own</strong>. I&#39;ll show you exactly how in a little bit...</li>\r\n	<li><strong>It&rsquo;s safe &amp; secure</strong>; WordPress is always updating their software and keeping everything sound and secure, so there&rsquo;s rarely a worry of having your blog come under hacking attacks. No wonder NASA, Time Magazine,&nbsp;and even top university blogs are using WordPress (<a href=\"http://www.wpexplorer.com/name-brands-use-wordpress/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.wpexplorer.com/name-brands-use-wordpress/\'); return false;\">2</a>).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>It&#39;s HIGHLY customizable</strong>.

Especially when you are just starting out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why You Shouldn&#39;t Create a Blog on a Free Blogging Platform</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a doubt, you need to&nbsp;<em>self-host</em>&nbsp;your WordPress blog. This means you are in complete control of your own website and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about it &ndash; what famous, successful blogger you know is using a free&nbsp;blogging website like &quot;www.startbloggingonline.freeblogsite.com&quot; instead of their own domain name like &ldquo;www.StartBloggingOnline.com&rdquo;, for example?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just that &ndash; free blogging platforms will cause you other headaches too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It gets worse:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>You don&rsquo;t control your content</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the blogging platform does. They could shut you down anytime, and for any reason (<a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/blogger/Oclynigp1OU\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/blogger/Oclynigp1OU\'); return false;\">3</a>).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>The web address of your blog will be long and hard to remember</strong>&nbsp;(like www.yourfreeblog.blogspot.com) instead of a catchy, branded address you choose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You&rsquo;re not allowed to advertise</strong>&nbsp;on most free blogging platforms, making it much harder to ever&nbsp;make money from blogging.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these limitations&nbsp;apply to the WordPress.COM blogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you really want is to self-host a WordPress.ORG blog - it&#39;s the same software without all the limitations!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If I were you</strong>, I&#39;d start with a self-hosted blog on my own domain from day one. That way you won&#39;t have to experience the massive technical headache I did when transferring from a free hosting to self-hosted blog.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting up a blog like this is WAY easier and less expensive than you might think, especially with the special deal and coupon code I&#39;ve got for you below...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding a Domain Name and Web Hosting Provider</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to the exciting part!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To set up a&nbsp;self-hosted blog on your own domain name, you&#39;ll need two things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Domain Name</strong>&nbsp;- This will be your personal blog address where people find your awesome articles over and over again. For example, Google&#39;s domain is www.Google.com. Your new blog domain name will be www.YourBlogName.com, except you&#39;ll choose what&#39;s going to be behind&nbsp;<em>YourNewBlog</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of a domain name is usually $10/year, but if you follow this guide all the way, I&#39;ll show you how to get one for much cheaper...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong>&nbsp;- This will be the home of your blog address and content that&#39;s on the blog. Without web hosting, you&#39;ll be unable to use your domain. Think of it as a computer hard drive that stores all your content on your blog (images, blog posts and so on).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of good web hosting is usually somewhere between $10-15 per month, but you will get over 70% OFF with the coupon code below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>With my special deal for you below</strong>&nbsp;the total cost will come out to less than a venti coffee at Starbucks a month - so it won&#39;t break the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&#39;s a relatively small, yet extremely important investment for your long-term blogging success.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where Should I Get My Domain Name and Hosting?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to web hosting,&nbsp;<em>there are only two things</em>&nbsp;that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Page load speed - The average amount of time (in seconds) it takes your blog to load.</li>\r\n	<li>Uptime - How often your site is up and running. 99.9% isn&#39;t enough (that&#39;s still 43 minutes of downtime per month). You should be aiming for 100%.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There are literally THOUSANDS of different web hosting providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, thousands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all offer you a similar service (domain name + hosting) with a relatively similar price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And luckily for you, I&#39;ve already done the research to narrow the list down to the one and only reliable service you should consider using for your first blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>&nbsp;As a longtime customer and independent review site, we get compensated if you purchase from the referral links below - at no additional cost to you.

This not only adds trust with Google, but with your site visitors as well!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an SSL Certificate, your domain name will start with HTTPS and show up as Secure with a green padlock next to the URL in a browser like this:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"SSL green padlock for starbloggingonline.com\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ssl-green-padlock-sbo-1.png\" style=\"height:89px; width:402px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, with HostGator your website will look legit from Day 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can always go with another web hosting service as long as it&#39;s fast, reliable, and offers unlimited storage &amp; bandwidth. This helps you to avoid problems later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve gone through the basics of blogging platforms, it&rsquo;s time to start walking the walk! With the next step, we&rsquo;ll get your blog set up and running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s get crackin&#39;:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 2: Set up a Blog on Your Own Domain Name (Self-Hosted WordPress)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you don&#39;t have a hosting or a domain name yet</strong>&nbsp;- don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be showing this in a minute...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of this step (2), you will have a fully working self-hosted WordPress blog on your own domain name!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds promising, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If for some odd reason you don&#39;t want to use HostGator, you can always choose another hosting provider. I can&#39;t promise they&#39;ll be that good, but the registration and the setup process should be somewhat similar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some hosting companies do not have one-click install for WordPress. If that&#39;s the case, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\'); return false;\">this guide</a>&nbsp;for installing WordPress manually (<em>not recommended for beginners, though</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1.

Pick a Domain Name For Your Blog</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Already have a domain name?&nbsp;</strong>If not, why not check out our post here to see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/how-much-is-a-domain-name/\" target=\"_blank\">how much a domain name</a>&nbsp;actually costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you already have one, then just write it in the right box (I already own this domain) and keep moving to the next step by scrolling down a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I choose a good domain name?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing a bad domain name is one of the most common mistakes I see bloggers make. Be sure you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/how-to-choose-domain-name/\" target=\"_blank\">choose a domain name</a>&nbsp;that is&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Easy to Remember -&nbsp;</strong>Don&rsquo;t choose a nonsense name, something tough to spell, or a long name full of dashes. &ldquo;www.best-tech-gadgets-in-the-world.com&rdquo; won&rsquo;t ever stick in someone&rsquo;s head, but something like &ldquo;www.techgeeks.com&rdquo; rolls off the tongue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Unique and Descriptive -&nbsp;</strong>You want a name that reflects who you are and what you care about. Be creative and build an identity you&rsquo;re excited about!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Trustworthy -&nbsp;</strong>Domain extensions like &ldquo;.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;.org&rdquo; or &ldquo;.net&rdquo; are the most popular, with &ldquo;.com&rdquo; being the one most people think of first. Try to avoid crazy extensions like &ldquo;.rocks&rdquo; or &ldquo;.biz&rdquo;, as these are less commonly used, tougher to remember and not as trusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type the domain name you want to use in the box, then click &ldquo;next&rdquo;. If the name is available, you&rsquo;ll be able to claim it. If it&#39;s not available, choose another one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Your_Blog_Domain\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Your_Blog_Domain.png\" style=\"height:256px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the name you want isn&rsquo;t available, HostGator will show you some alternatives that are similar &ndash; or you can punch in a new name and try again. I&#39;d suggest you use something that ends with&nbsp;<em>.com, .net or .org</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Choose Your Blog Hosting Plan</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend the &ldquo;<strong>Hatchling</strong>&rdquo; plan for now &ndash; you can always upgrade later if you decide you want more advanced features, but you get more than enough to get started with the Hatchling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"choose_blog_hosting_plan\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/choose_blog_hosting_plan.png\" style=\"height:296px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Complete Your Registration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen the Hatchling plan and found a name you like that&rsquo;s available, you&rsquo;ll need to register it by putting in your contact and billing information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also have a chance to customize your package a bit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is a chance to save some more money, so don&rsquo;t skip it! Be sure to apply the discount code &quot;STARTBLOG&quot; for 72% off.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/hostgator-hp6d\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO START YOUR BLOG</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"extra services for hg signup\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/additional_blog_services_2.png\" style=\"height:504px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would take a look at each of these additional services to see if you want any of them, but they are not 100% necessary for you at this stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Log In To Your New Account And Install WordPress Blog</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It may take a few minutes for HostGator to register your account, so be patient. You will get a confirmation email when your new account is officially ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"hostgator confirmation\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/email_confirmation.png\" style=\"height:156px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve logged in to your&nbsp;<strong>control panel</strong>&nbsp;(all the information you need for that should be in your inbox), it&rsquo;s time to install WordPress. Thankfully, this takes just one click!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Log-in to your Hostgator control panel</li>\r\n	<li>At the top click &ldquo;Get Started With WordPress Today&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li>If WordPress isn&#39;t there for some reason, scroll down a little bit on the control panel and click on &quot;Quick Install&quot; under the Software &amp; Services section.&nbsp;Look at the top of&nbsp;the page, in the left sidebar&nbsp;section for WordPress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once clicked, you&rsquo;ll be automatically transferred to Mojomarketplace.com &ndash; don&rsquo;t panic, this is just a site that helps HostGator install platforms (like WordPress).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should immediately see a screen where you&rsquo;re offered to &ldquo;Install&rdquo; or &ldquo;Import&rdquo; WordPress. Click &ldquo;Install&rdquo; to get to the next step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re finished, &ldquo;Install WordPress&rdquo;. Once you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;ll see a loading bar at the top of your page that will eventually tell you that your WordPress blog has been installed and you&#39;ll see your log-in credentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"blog_install_finished\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/blog_install_finished.png\" style=\"height:156px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6. Log In And Check Out Your New Blog</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the installation completes, you&rsquo;ll get an email that shares your login information, including an &ldquo;Admin URL&rdquo;. (In case you missed that notification bar)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To log in to your blog, click the admin URL. If you forget this URL, it&rsquo;s simply www.yourblog.com/wp-admin (where &ldquo;yourblog&rdquo; is your domain name).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New Blog Homepage (1-6 steps)\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/start_new_blog_homepage.png\" style=\"height:239px; width:640px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Congratulations &ndash; you now know how to make a blog using WordPress. You&#39;ve installed WordPress and set up your blog, all on your own! As you can see, it was really easy and straightforward.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that your blog is set up,&nbsp;read on to learn how to design your blog and make your very first post.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 3: Designing Your Blog</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In this section, I&rsquo;ll show you some WordPress blog basics, including:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Changing your blog&#39;s design</li>\r\n	<li>Installing new WordPress plugins/features</li>\r\n	<li>Making your blog search engine friendly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve set up your blog, you&rsquo;re now ready to start using WordPress and customizing your blog. I promise - it&#39;ll be pretty easy and fun at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remember</strong>: You can log in to your blog by going to&nbsp;<strong>www.yourblog.com/wp-admin/</strong>&nbsp;and using the credentials you set up with HostGator or any other hosting company you used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"WordPress blog\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/customized_WordPress-2.jpg\" style=\"height:535px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sample of a customized WordPress blog (SmartPassiveIncome.com)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Changing Your Blog&rsquo;s Design (Themes &amp; Layouts)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>WordPress blogging platform uses&nbsp;<strong>design templates called &ldquo;WordPress Themes&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;to figure out how your site should look. Changing your blog&rsquo;s layout and design is as simple as installing a new theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are over 2,000 professionally designed, fully-customizable and free themes to choose from &ndash; so you&rsquo;ve got a lot of options. If you want to see premium themes and designs like the Genesis Framework, head over to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/go/themeforest\">Themeforest.net</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here&rsquo;s How To Find And Install A Theme You Love:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you log in for the first time, you&rsquo;ll see a dashboard or admin panel that looks something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Your_WordPress_dashboard\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/Your_WordPress_dashboard-2.jpg\" style=\"height:335px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mouse-over the &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; tab in the WordPress sidebar, then click on &ldquo;Themes&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"find_a_perfect_theme\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/find_a_perfect_theme-2.jpg\" style=\"height:335px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the next screen, you&rsquo;ll see several themes are already installed. If you don&rsquo;t like those, click the &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; button at the top, or the great big &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; square to start searching for a theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"add_new_theme\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/add_new_theme-2.jpg\" style=\"height:249px; width:680px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll see tabs where you&rsquo;ll find featured, popular and brand new themes, as well as a &ldquo;Feature Filter&rdquo; and search bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"featured_themes\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/featured_themes-2.jpg\" style=\"height:279px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really like the &ldquo;Feature Filter&rdquo; option, because you can choose themes in certain color schemes, select specific layouts and even choose themes with built-in advanced features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just choose the options you want, then click &ldquo;Apply Filters&rdquo; on the left hand side. If you&rsquo;re finding this challenging, just search by keyword &ndash; there&rsquo;s no wrong way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"apply_filters\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/apply_filters-2.jpg\" style=\"height:391px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve found a theme you like, click &ldquo;Install&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re nearly done!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the theme has been installed, all that&rsquo;s left to do is click &ldquo;Activate&rdquo; on the next screen:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"activate_your_blog_theme\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/activate_your_blog_theme-2.jpg\" style=\"height:317px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Configuring Your Blog To Be Search Engine Friendly</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some&nbsp;things you&#39;d need to do to make your blog more search engine friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Search engines&nbsp;<strong>do not like two things</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Ugly and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/using-searchenginefriendly-urls-in-your-business-w.html\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/using-searchenginefriendly-urls-in-your-business-w.html\'); return false;\">clumsy URL-s</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>http://yourblog.com/2012/04/topic-a/author-Karen/how-to-start-a-blog.&nbsp;</em>A much better way is to use:&nbsp;<em>http://yourblog.com/start-a-blog</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>See the difference? One is filled with irrelevant information and the other one is short, clean and neat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to change your links to a more cleaner, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Permalinks&quot; and use the following settings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"permalinks\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/permalinks1-2.jpg\" style=\"height:435px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Spam comments - Unfortunately, lots of people want to leave automated spam comments on your blog. They do that for a couple of reasons - to get people from your blog to their blog and to advertise their services/products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid that, make sure you moderate your comments. Here&#39;s how to do that: Go to &quot;Settings&quot; --&gt; &quot;Discussion&quot; and tick those two options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"disable_comments\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/disable_comments1-2.jpg\" style=\"height:282px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 4: Adding &amp; Writing Blog Posts and Pages</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By now you should have a fully working WordPress blog on your very own domain name.

Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have to move it later on.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Adding_media\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/Adding_media-2.jpg\" style=\"height:382px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, click the &ldquo;Upload Files&rdquo; tab on the screen that pops up, then click &ldquo;Select Files&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"adding_images_blog_post\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/adding_images_blog_post-2.jpg\" style=\"height:330px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found the file, double-click it and WordPress will upload it automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the upload is finished, make sure the image you want is selected, then click the &ldquo;Insert into post&rdquo; button to add the image to the post you&rsquo;re writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"insert_image_into_blogpost\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/insert_image_into_blogpost-2.jpg\" style=\"height:331px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Adding a Link</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Linking out to other websites is a great way to build relationships and share interesting content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add a link, click on the icon in the toolbar that looks a bit like a chain link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"instert_a_blog_link\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/instert_a_blog_link-2.jpg\" style=\"height:121px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the pop-up, you&rsquo;ll need to enter a few important bits of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Adding_link2\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/Adding_link2-2.jpg\" style=\"height:810px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>URL</strong>&nbsp;is the web address of the link you want to share. Make sure you include &ldquo;http://&rdquo; before the &ldquo;www.&rdquo; address, or your link will be broken.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>&ldquo;Link Text&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>is the text you want people to click on to get to your link. It might be &ldquo;Click here&rdquo;, or anything you choose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>&ldquo;Open link in a new window/tab&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;s a smart idea to check this box. Otherwise, when someone clicks your link, they&rsquo;ll leave your blog.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>If you want to link to an existing page,&nbsp;</strong>you can use the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; section to find a post or page you&rsquo;ve already created and click it to add a link.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, click &ldquo;Add Link&rdquo;, and your link will be added where you left your cursor in the post you were writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Adding Headers &amp; Editing Text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to use headers and bolding to make your content easier to read and scan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding Headings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add a heading, click on the drop-down menu on the bottom left of the toolbar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Blog_Post_Headings\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/Blog_Post_Headings-2.jpg\" style=\"height:744px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to only use &ldquo;Heading 1&rdquo; once within your page (usually at the top), and use &ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;Heading 3&rdquo; for other sections in the copy, as this is better for search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tip: You can also highlight the text you want to change in your blog post, THEN click on the drop-down menu and select the format you want the text to be in.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Editing Fonts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also bold, italicize, underline and even change the color of your text in a click or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"change_font\" src=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/homepage/change_font-2.jpg\" style=\"height:69px; width:560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;B&rdquo; is for bolding</li>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;I&rdquo; is for italics</li>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;U&rdquo; is to underline your text</li>\r\n	<li>&ldquo;A&rdquo; will open a dropdown menu where you can select font color</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, this is all pretty simple for anyone who has worked with Microsoft Word before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 5:&nbsp;Start Growing Your Blog</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have set up your blog and know the basics, it&#39;s time to make your blog successful.

Over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(\'https://wordpress.com/activity/\'); return false;\">409 million people read blog posts every month</a>. You&#39;re reading one right now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: What&#39;s the difference between a blog and a website?&nbsp;</strong>A: Blogs are frequently updated&nbsp;with articles while a website is generally &quot;set it and forget it&quot;. Blogs might have fewer features than a website and just focus on creating really good content. For this reason, a blog is more socially active, with shares and comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startbloggingonline.com/como-crear-un-blog/\">Lee esta Gu&iacute;a en Espa&ntilde;ol</a></p>\r\n', '2019-01-03 05:05:55', 'c9abc0deff234cf5fdbad5df5ecf721b.png');

(20, 'Android', 'Android 9 Pie: Powered by AI for a smarter, simple', '<p>The latest release of Android is here! And it comes with a heaping helping of artificial intelligence baked in to make your phone smarter, simpler and more tailored to you. Today we&rsquo;re officially introducing Android 9 Pie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve built Android 9 to learn from you&mdash;and work better&nbsp;<em>for you</em>&mdash;the more you use it. From predicting your next task so you can jump right into the action you want to take, to prioritizing battery power for the apps you use most, to helping you disconnect from your phone at the end of the day, Android 9 adapts to your life and the ways you like to use your phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tailored to you</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 9 aims to make your phone even smarter by learning from you and adapting to your usage patterns. That&rsquo;s why Android 9 comes with features like&nbsp;<strong>Adaptive Battery</strong>, which learns the apps you use most and prioritizes battery for them, and&nbsp;<strong>Adaptive Brightness</strong>, which learns how you like to set the brightness in different settings, and does it for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"battery-brightness.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/battery-brightness.gif\" style=\"height:429px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 9 also helps you get things done faster with&nbsp;<strong>App Actions</strong>, which predicts what you&rsquo;ll want to do next based on your context and displays that action right on your phone. Say it&rsquo;s Tuesday morning and you&rsquo;re preparing for your commute: you&rsquo;ll be suggested actions like navigating to work on Google Maps or resuming an audiobook with Google Play Books. And when you put in headphones after work, you may see options to call your mom or start your favorite Spotify playlist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Android 9 App Actions\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/last-app-actions-2.gif\" style=\"height:648px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later this fall, we&rsquo;ll also roll out&nbsp;<strong>Slices</strong>&nbsp;(pie...slices...get it?!) which shows relevant information from your favorite apps when you need it. If you start typing &ldquo;Lyft&rdquo; into Google Search, you&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of the Lyft app, showing prices for your ride home and the ETA for a driver so you can take action more quickly and easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"android 9 pie - slices\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Slices_Blog_cropped.gif\" style=\"height:600px; width:292px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Now easy as pie</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Making your phone smarter and more adaptive is important, but we also want Android to be easier to use and more approachable. In Android 9, we&rsquo;ve introduced a&nbsp;<strong>new system navigation</strong>&nbsp;featuring a single home button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is especially helpful as phones grow taller and it&rsquo;s more difficult to get things done on your phone with one hand. With a single, clean home button, you can swipe up to see a newly designed Overview, the spot where at a glance you have full-screen previews of your recently used apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swipe up from anywhere to see full-screen previews of recently used apps and simply tap to jump back into one of them. If you find yourself constantly switching between apps on your Pixel, we&rsquo;ve got good news for you:&nbsp;<strong>Smart Text Selection</strong>&nbsp;(which recognizes the meaning of the text you&rsquo;re selecting and suggests relevant actions) now works on the Overview of your recent apps, making it easier to perform the action you want. You can enable this new system navigation in Settings once you&rsquo;ve received your update to Android 9 (learn more in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7443425\" target=\"_blank\">help center</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Intuitive_nav1.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Intuitive_nav1.gif\" style=\"height:432px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changing how you navigate your phone is a big deal, but small changes can make a big difference too. Android P also brings a redesigned Quick Settings, a better way to take and edit screenshots (say goodbye to the vulcan grip that was required before), simplified volume controls, an easier way to manage notifications and more. You&rsquo;ll notice small changes like these across the platform, to help make the things you do all the time easier than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Find the balance that&rsquo;s right for your life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While much of the time we spend on our phones is useful, many of us wish we could disconnect more easily and free up time for other things. In fact, over 70 percent of people we talked to in our research said they want more help with this. So we&rsquo;ve been working to add key capabilities right into Android to help people achieve the balance with technology they&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Google I/O in May, we previewed some of these digital wellbeing features for Android, including a new&nbsp;<strong>Dashboard</strong>&nbsp;that helps you understand how you&rsquo;re spending time on your device; an&nbsp;<strong>App Timer</strong>&nbsp;that lets you set time limits on apps and grays out the icon on your home screen when the time is up; the new&nbsp;<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>, which silences all the visual interruptions that pop up on your screen; and&nbsp;<strong>Wind Down</strong>, which switches on Night Light and Do Not Disturb and fades the screen to grayscale before bedtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"AndroidPie_DigitalWellbeing\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/triptych_v2.gif\" style=\"height:393px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital Wellbeing will officially launch on Pixel phones this fall, with Android One and other devices coming later this year. But these features are available in beta now for Pixel phones running Android 9. To try them out:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Make sure you&rsquo;re running Android 9 Pie on your device.

And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/devices/\" target=\"_blank\">devices</a>&nbsp;that participated in the Beta program from Sony Mobile, Xiaomi, HMD Global, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus and Essential, as well as all qualifying Android One devices, will receive this update by the end of this fall. We&#39;re also working with a number of other partners to launch or upgrade devices to Android 9 this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about Android 9 Pie at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://android.com/9\" target=\"_blank\">android.com/9</a>.</p>\r\n', '2019-01-03 09:56:06', 'img-1.jpg');
